# cbackup

cbackup is a simple backup/restore script for rooted Android devices. It backs up apps, full app data, and some Android metadata.

## Quickstart

Run the following command in Termux to take a backup:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -LSs https://git.io/JUl3K)"
```

If you're worried about piping and running a random script, the [quickstart script](https://github.com/kdrag0n/cbackup/blob/master/termux-quickstart.sh) is short and thoroughly commented, so feel free to download it and read it yourself before running it.
