# cbackup

cbackup is a simple backup/restore script for rooted Android devices. It backs up apps, full app data, and some Android metadata.

## Quickstart

Run the following command in Termux to take a backup:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -LSs https://git.io/cbackup-quick)"
```

You can also specify a destination folder as an argument, which will be cleared if it already exists and created otherwise:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -LSs https://git.io/cbackup-quick)" backup /data/local/tmp/cbackup
```

To restore a backup located at `/sdcard/cbackup`:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -LSs https://git.io/cbackup-quick)" restore
```

Or restore a backup from a custom location:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -LSs https://git.io/cbackup-quick)" restore /data/local/tmp/cbackup
```

Using a custom path outside of `/sdcard`, e.g. `/data/local/tmp/cbackup`, will work significantly faster on Android 11 and newer.

If you're worried about piping and running a random script, the [quickstart script](https://github.com/kdrag0n/cbackup/blob/master/termux-quickstart.sh) is short and thoroughly commented, so feel free to download it and read it yourself before running it.

## Scope

cbackup includes the following data for each app:

- App packages (APKs, including split APKs from Android App Bundles)
- App private data (excluding cache and data explicitly marked as no-backup)
- Per-app Android device IDs (SSAIDs; only restored if you reboot immediately after restoring)
- Granted dangerous runtime permissions
- Whether battery optimization is enabled
- Name of the installer app that installed the app in question, e.g. Play Store

cbackup **does not** include:

- Account information registered with Android's AccountManager service
- App external data stored in `/sdcard/Android/data`
- OBBs stored in `/sdcard/Android/obb`, e.g. game resources
- Device-bound keystore encryption keys (not possible to extract by design)

Some security-centric apps that use device-bound keystore keys to encrypt their data are included in a builtin blacklist, so their data will not be backed up.

Only apps installed in the primary user profile (Android user ID 0) will be backed up. Work profiles and other users will be excluded.

## Usage

If you run the script with no arguments, it will default to creating a new backup located at `backup_dir` its settings, which is set to `/sdcard/cbackup` by default.

cbackup accepts the following optional positional arguments:

- First argument: mode â€” `backup` or `restore`
- Second argument: backup path

Example to restore from a backup located at `/data/local/tmp/cbackup`:

```bash
./cbackup.sh restore /data/local/tmp/cbackup
```

And to back up to `/data/local/tmp/cbackup`:

```bash
./cbackup.sh backup /data/local/tmp/cbackup
```

## Storage format

The preliminary v0 storage format is currently used by the cbackup shell script.

### v0 (preliminary)

All data related to each app is stored in a folder with the app's package name. The following files will always be present:

- `backup_version.txt`: plain-text file containing `0\n`
- `password_canary.enc`: encrypted file containing `cbackup-valid`
- `base.apk`: unencrypted base APK file

The following files may or may not be present, depending on what data is associated with the app that is being backed up:

- `split_config.*.apk`: unencrypted additional split APKs with resources
- `data.tar.zst.enc`: encrypted tarball archive containing app data, compressed with Zstandard before encrypting
- `permissions.list`: unencrypted list of granted runtime permissions
- `ssaid.xml`: system-generated SSAID entry from the SSAID settings XML
- `battery_opt_disabled`: empty file, the presence of this file indicates that battery optimization is disabled
- `installer_name.txt`: unencrypted plain-text file containing the installer app's package name

All encrypted files are encrypted using the OpenSSL CLI tool with the AES-256-CTR block cipher and 32-byte key derived from the user's password using 200,001 iterations of PBKDF2 and a random salt stored in the file's header.

App data includes both main CE-encrypted data as well as DE-encrypted (Direct Boot) data. App, code, and shader caches are always excluded, as well as files placed by apps in the dedicated no-backup folder.
